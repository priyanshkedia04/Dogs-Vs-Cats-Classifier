# Dogs-Vs-Cats-Classifier

A deep Convolution Neural Network model was built for binary classification between Cats and Dogs images using TensorFlow and Keras in Python. Dataset was taken from Kaggle comprising 12,500 images of both cats and dogs.
45 epochs were carried out on 6,250 images per epoch and validation was done on 2500 images per epoch. The training was less due to less computational Power available.

Train Accuracy: 80.24%

Validation Accuracy: 84.56%
